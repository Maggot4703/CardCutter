how do i crop the right hand side of a picture using 'gimp' on a raspberry pi 4


To crop the right-hand side of an image using GIMP on a Raspberry Pi, you can follow these steps:

1. Open GIMP and load the image that you want to crop.
2. Go to the "Image" menu and select "Crop". This will open the Crop dialog box.
3. In the Crop dialog box, set the following options:
	* X position: Set this to the desired x-position of the top left corner of the cropped image, measured from the left edge of the original image. For example, if you want to crop the right-hand side of the image, you can set this option to the width of the original image minus the amount you want to crop.
	* Y position: Set this to 0 (zero).
	* Width: Set this to the desired width of the cropped image. For example, if you want to crop the right-hand side of the image, you can set this option to the width of the original image minus the amount you want to crop.
	* Height: Set this to the height of the original image.
4. Click "OK" to apply the crop settings and save the cropped image.

Note that the units used for the x-position, y-position, width, and height options are pixels. You can also use other units such as centimeters or inches if you prefer.
